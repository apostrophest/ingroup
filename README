ingroup

Ingroup is a lightweight internet forum software written in Python and currently in early alpha status. It focuses on the needs of small groups of people who already know each other from another context.

In practice, this means there is little need for complex user hierarchies, sophisticated management tools, and other meta features that make many popular forum software unwieldy.

Additionally, while not a firm goal, ingroup will hopefully provide a decent basis for other developers to build up lightweight forums built on Python.
